# WeatherAPI

Basic weatherAPI coded in javascript, css for styling, html as always. For now it only shows temperature, what the temperature feels like and pressure
but other informations is pure formality. API can convert kalvin units to celcius and other way around. I plan to make picture on the top change based on what the weather is 
like in the city, e.g. snowy landscape while checking place where it's snowing and so on. Javascript code is based on asynchrous function (fetch).
